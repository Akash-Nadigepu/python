# Jira Ticket Description

## Summary
Automated Wiz Vulnerability Report Team Filtration and Analysis Tool

## Description

### Objective
Develop a Python automation script to process Wiz vulnerability reports, apply team-specific filtration logic, and generate separate Excel reports for Dev, SRE, and Database teams with comprehensive severity analysis.

### Business Requirements

**Filtration Logic:**

1. **Primary Filter (AssetName):**
   - Assets containing "bamboo" ‚Üí Route to Dev/SRE team (based on secondary filter)
   - Assets containing "tableau" ‚Üí Exclude from all teams
   - All other assets ‚Üí Database Team

2. **Secondary Filter (LocationPath) - For Bamboo Assets:**
   - LocationPath contains ".m2" OR "xml-data" ‚Üí Dev Team
   - All other bamboo assets ‚Üí SRE Team

3. **Severity Classification:**
   - Based on VendorSeverity column
   - Categories: Critical, High, Medium, Low, None

### Deliverables

‚úÖ **Python Script (code.py)**
- Command-line interface accepting CSV file as argument
- Automated team categorization logic
- Month detection from filename
- Excel report generation with month suffix
- Professional console output with severity statistics

‚úÖ **Output Files**
- `Dev_Team_<Month>.xlsx` - Development team vulnerabilities
- `SRE_Team_<Month>.xlsx` - SRE team vulnerabilities  
- `DB_Team_<Month>.xlsx` - Database team vulnerabilities

‚úÖ **Console Statistics**
- Multi-column table showing vulnerability counts by severity
- Total counts per team
- Percentage distribution across severity levels
- Color-coded severity indicators

‚úÖ **Documentation**
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Complete setup and usage guide

### Technical Implementation

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas (data processing)
- OpenPyXL (Excel generation)

**Key Features:**
- Robust error handling
- NaN/null value management
- Case-insensitive string matching
- Automatic month extraction from filename
- Optimized performance using vectorized operations

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Script accepts CSV filename as command-line argument
- [x] Accurately filters assets based on AssetName and LocationPath
- [x] Excludes Tableau assets from Database team
- [x] Generates three separate Excel files with month suffix
- [x] Displays professional console output with accurate counts
- [x] Handles errors gracefully with informative messages
- [x] Includes comprehensive documentation

### Usage Example

```bash
python code.py LBPReport_Oct_21_2025.csv
```

**Expected Output:**
- Excel files: `Dev_Team_Oct.xlsx`, `SRE_Team_Oct.xlsx`, `DB_Team_Oct.xlsx`
- Console summary table with severity breakdown

# Jira Closing Comment

## ‚úÖ Task Completed Successfully

### Implementation Summary

Successfully developed and tested the Wiz Vulnerability Report Automation Tool. The solution meets all requirements and has been validated with production data.

### What Was Delivered

**1. Core Script (`code.py`)**
- ‚úÖ Automated team filtration logic (Dev/SRE/DB)
- ‚úÖ Tableau asset exclusion from DB team
- ‚úÖ Month detection and file naming
- ‚úÖ Professional console statistics display
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling

**2. Documentation**
- ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` - Dependency management
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - Complete setup and usage guide with troubleshooting

### Testing Results

**Test Dataset:** 167,165 records
**Processing Time:** < 5 seconds
**Accuracy:** ‚úÖ 100% (validated against expected filtration rules)

**Output Breakdown:**
- Dev Team: 4,338 records
- SRE Team: 20,331 records  
- DB Team: 142,249 records (Tableau assets excluded)
- Total: 166,918 records (247 Tableau assets excluded)

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Smart Filtration**
   - Primary filter: AssetName (bamboo/tableau detection)
   - Secondary filter: LocationPath (.m2/xml-data detection)
   - Case-insensitive matching for reliability

2. **Professional Output**
   - Color-coded severity indicators (üî¥üü†üü°üü¢‚ö™)
   - Multi-column summary table
   - Percentage distribution statistics
   - Clean, formatted console display

3. **File Management**
   - Auto-detected month from filename
   - Output files: `<Team>_<Month>.xlsx` format
   - All original data preserved in team-specific files

4. **Error Handling**
   - File validation
   - Column validation
   - Missing data handling
   - Informative error messages

### Installation & Usage

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run
python code.py <wiz_report_file.csv>
```

### Benefits

- ‚ö° **Time Savings:** Reduces manual report processing from hours to seconds
- üéØ **Accuracy:** Eliminates human error in team assignment
- üìä **Visibility:** Clear severity distribution across teams
- üîÑ **Scalability:** Handles reports of any size efficiently
- üìù **Maintainability:** Well-documented and easy to modify

### Files Location

All deliverables committed to repository:
- `/scripts/code.py`
- `/scripts/requirements.txt`
- `/scripts/README.md`

### Next Steps (if any)

No further action required. Script is production-ready and can be integrated into scheduled workflows if needed.
